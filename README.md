### Project Description:
That’s the project I’ve done with the cooperation with my Friend. The reason was to learn how to cooperate with other Developers on one project, using GitHub together, communicate, review PR’s and support each other. I learned good convention of git commits and proper descriptions on Github. I also learned how to work on the project together with other developers.
